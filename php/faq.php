					<p class="q"><span>Q: </span>Which is the best time to visit Sri Lanka?</p>
					<p class="a" style="text-align: justify;"><span>A: </span>If you are planning to book one of the Sri Lanka packages, 
					you must first consider the best time to visit the island nation. Tropical jungles, sparkling beaches, 
					azure waters, rich history, a vibrant culture, spirituality and biodiversity symbolise Sri Lanka, 
					and owing to its diverse topography it remains a top destination on the list of holidaymakers. 
					The country experiences distinct dry and wet seasons. The south western monsoon brings rain to 
					Sri Lankaâ€™s south western region between May and November and keeping it dry between December and April. 
					The north eastern monsoon on the other hand brings rain to the eastern and northern coastal regions between 
					October and January, keeping it dry between May and September. For a culture connoisseur and sunshine lover, 
					the December to April window is the best to visit Sri Lanka as this is generally the dry period and a great 
					time to visit its historical ruins, elaborate temples, old-world churches and its hill stations. The shoulder 
					season, however, remains between September and November. But you need to avoid Sri Lanka between May and 
					August because of the heat and humidity making it impossible to travel around.</p>

				<div class="qa">
				
					<p class="q"><b>Q: </b>What is the local language of Sri Lanka?</p>
					<p class="a" style="text-align: justify;"><b>A: </b>Before you shortlist one of the Sri Lanka holiday packages, you must know of its 
					local language and whether or not you would be comfortable travelling around the country. Sinhala, 
					the native language of the Sinhalese people is most widely spoken while the other fraction speaks Tamil. 
					English serves as a link language and most cabbies, hotels and places of entertainment speak and 
					understand English. So you can do with English in most part of the country, especially touristy places 
					like Bentota, Colombo, Negombo, Kandy among others. But if you are travelling rurally, it might not be 
					the case, as the folks would converse only in their local language. But on the whole you can get around 
					in Sri Lanka with just English.</p>

					<p class="q"><span><b>Q: </b></span>How to get a tourist visa to Sri Lanka?</p>
					<p class="a" style="text-align: justify;"><span><b>A: </b></span>Getting a tourist visa to Sri Lanka for an Indian is considerably easy. 
					An Indian passport holder needs to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation or ETA and you are granted a 
					stay for up to 30 days in a go. The ETA though remains valid for 180 days after issued from the date of 
					application and lets you gain double entry into the country. All you need to submit is a scanned copy of 
					your passport and email address. The ETA is generally processed within 5 working days and the processing 
					charges are 40USD including service fee.</p>
